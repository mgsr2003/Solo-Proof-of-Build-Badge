🎯 Solo Proof-of-Build Badge — DIDLab Submission



This project is completed as part of the DIDLab Solo Build challenge.  

It demonstrates the ability to deploy a smart contract, upload assets to IPFS,  

and mint an evidence-backed NFT on the DIDLab blockchain network.



---



\## ✅ Project Overview



| Component | Description |

|----------|-------------|

| ✅ IPFS Upload | Image + metadata uploaded using JWT authenticated API |

| ✅ Smart Contract | Minimal ERC-721 NFT contract deployed on DIDLab chain |

| ✅ NFT Minting | Minted NFT pointing to the uploaded IPFS metadata |

| ✅ Evidence | On-chain and off-chain proof attached in repo |



This verifies end-to-end understanding of decentralized identity,  

Web3 development, and blockchain interaction.

\## 🚀 How It Works

1️⃣ Authenticate → Get DIDLab JWT  

2️⃣ Upload assets to IPFS via API  

3️⃣ Deploy ERC-721 contract  

4️⃣ Mint NFT referencing metadata  

5️⃣ Submit both on-chain and IPFS proofs  

6️⃣ Push final repo to GitHub ✅
